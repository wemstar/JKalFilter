    A Linear Kalman Filter implementation. The filter needs to be initialized
    with the proper Kalman matrices (take care of proper dimensions) and a given
    valid estimates of initial state and covariance.

    Once initialized, the user has full control over what he does with the
    filter. If he so wishes, he can manually step it::

        >>> filt = LKFilter(A, H, x, P, Q, R)
        >>> for measurement in measurement_list:
        ...     estimate = filt.step(measurement)
        ...     # do something with estimate
        ...

    He can also iterate over a filter when it has measurements assigned to it::

        >>> filtered = []
        >>> filt.add_meas(measurement_list)
        >>> for estimate in filt:
        ...    # process estimate
        ...    filtered.append(estimate)

    If the user needs a more fine-grained control, he has access to the functions
    :py:meth:`.update` and :py:meth:`.predict`, the two basic building stones
    of a Kalman filter iteration. At any time the current state estimate of the filter can be accessed using the :py:attr:`.state` property.
